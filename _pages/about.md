I am a PoliSci PhD Candidate at [ICS-ULisboa](https://www.ics.ulisboa.pt/pessoa/joris-david-alberdingk-thijm) specializing in coalition governance in presidential systems. I specifically study how coalition partners in multiparty presidential cabinets manage delegation to one another using junior ministers and legislative committee chairpersons. I approach this issue comparatively, leveraging 9 country cases in Latin America, Africa and Asia. My research is funded by a stipend from the [Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia](https://www.fct.pt/).

Aside from the research for my thesis, I am pursuing a second line of research in which I apply qualitative data analysis (QDA) to Brazilian politics.

I am currently (Fall 2023) spending a semester as a visiting scholar at Texas A&M University.
